# Agent Plugins for AWS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Generative AI can make mistakes. You should consider reviewing all output and costs generated by your chosen AI model and agentic coding assistant. See [AWS Responsible AI Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/policy/).

Agent Plugins for AWS equip AI coding agents with the skills to help you architect, deploy, and operate on AWS. Agent plugins are currently supported by Claude Code.

## Plugins

| Plugin                                     | Description                                                                                      | Status    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| [**aws-amplify**](plugins/aws-amplify)     | Build full-stack apps with AWS Amplify Gen 2 using guided workflows and SOPs                     | Available |
| [**deploy-on-aws**](plugins/deploy-on-aws) | Deploy applications to AWS with architecture recommendations, cost estimates, and IaC deployment | Available |

## Installation (Claude Code)

### Add the marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add awslabs/agent-plugins
```

### Install a plugin

```bash
/plugin install deploy-on-aws@awslabs-agent-plugins
```

## deploy-on-aws

Equips agents with the skills to accelerate AWS deployment - recommending AWS architectures and services, estimating costs, generating Infrastructure as Code (CDK or CloudFormation), and guiding you through deployment.

### Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Scan codebase for framework, database, dependencies
2. **Recommend** - Select AWS services with concise rationale
3. **Estimate** - Show cost estimates before proceeding
4. **Generate** - Write IaC code (CDK/CloudFormation)
5. **Deploy** - Execute with user confirmation

### Skill Triggers

| Skill      | Triggers                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **deploy** | "deploy to AWS", "host on AWS", "run this on AWS", "AWS architecture", "estimate AWS cost", "generate infrastructure" |

### MCP Servers

| Server           | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **awsknowledge** | AWS documentation, architecture guidance, and best practices |
| **awspricing**   | Real-time AWS service pricing for cost estimates             |
| **aws-iac-mcp**  | IaC best practices for CDK/CloudFormation                    |
